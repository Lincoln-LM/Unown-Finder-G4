Some concepts in this code are taken from [PokeFinder](https://github.com/Admiral-Fish/PokeFinder) so credit to *Admiral Fish* for that tool.

Credit for the original gen 4 unown tool [KnownUnown](http://co291424.com/tool/KnownUnown.php) go to *GonZ*

and finally the info on the rng is credited to *Yie*'s writeup on Twitter which can be found [here.](https://twitter.com/_gon_z/status/1151871686607687681?s=21)
